What does it do:
Logs all python calls with arguments, time stamp and on which machine it was called plus a short message in a logfile

How to install:
- copy autologcmd.py and pythony to your ~/bin folder. Create it if does not exist.
- set LOGFILE in ~/bin/autologcmd.py to a filepath of your choosing. The script only appends, never deletes.
- chmod +x ~/bin/pythony
- source ~/.bashrc to update paths
- if you still cannot call 'pythony', add ~/bin to your PATH variable

How to use:
Instead of calling your scripts via python, call pythony and add an extra argument starting with % to add a message
e.g. instead of
python -m src.script --flag0 crazyvalue --awesomeflag yes -g -y -i --dont --know someotherarguments
do:
pythony -m src.script --flag0 crazyvalue --awesomeflag yes -g -y -i --dont --know someotherarguments %"This message is supposed to remember me about this particular experiment. Should be something like a git message. So far only one liners are supported."

It does not matter where the %"..." in the arguments is located. It is processed and removed before calling the actual python script

Hope it may help
